# Games

This repository is a collection of all the games that I have created in various different languages. These include the following games:

  <summary> <H3> <i> Chess: </i> </H3> </summary>
  <p> I developed a fully functional console based 2 players Chess game in C++ with the traditional rules and logic. The game keeps the track of all the chess pieces with a Hash Map and the board with a 2D 
  integer array. The White pieces are numbered +ively and the Black pieces are numbered -ively for their easier control and manipulation. <br><br>
  The game logic and input cleaning is done in separate files and linked to the main game file for cleanliness. In the future, I am planning on adding an AI based mechanism to include a singleplayer
  playthrough with Comp v Human. </p>

  <summary> <H3> <i> Conway's Game of Life: </i> </H3> </summary>
  <p> This is my interpretation of the Game of Life developed by John Conway. To know more about the game and how it works, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouipbDkwHWA"> here </a>. <br><br>
  I use a 2D integer matrix to store the game state at each generation. The console displays it on the screen. If the board doesn't automatically stabilize within n generations, the game stops. Else the last
  stable generation is displayed and the program breaks off. <br><br>
  I am planning to add a graphical interface in the future so that the game mechanics can be more beautifully looked at and interacted with. </p>
