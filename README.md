# Games

This repository is a collection of all the games that I have created in various different languages. These include the following games:

### - _Chess:_
I developed a fully functional console based 2 players Chess game in C++ with the traditional rules and logic. The game keeps the track of all the chess pieces with a Hash Map and the board with a 2D integer array. The White pieces are numbered +ively and the Black pieces are numbered -ively for their easier control and manipulation.
The game logic and input cleaning is done in separate files and linked to the main game file for cleanliness.
In the future, I am planning on adding an AI based mechanism to include a singleplayer playthrough with Comp v Human.

### - _Conway's Game of Life:_

### - _Snake Game:_

### - _Tic Tac Toe (Minimax):_

### - _Other Small Games:_
